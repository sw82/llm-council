Question: {user_query}

Here are the responses from different models (anonymized):

Your task:
1. First, evaluate each response individually. For each response, explain what it does well and what it does poorly.
2. Then, at the very end of your response, provide a final ranking.

IMPORTANT: Your final ranking MUST be formatted EXACTLY as follows:
- Start with the line "FINAL RANKING:" (all caps, with colon)
- Then list the responses from best to worst as a numbered list
- Each line should be: number, period, space, then ONLY the response label (e.g., "1. Response A")
- Do not add any other text or explanations in the ranking section

Example of the correct format for your ENTIRE response:

Response A provides good detail on X but misses Y...
Response B is accurate but lacks depth on Z...
Response C offers the most comprehensive answer...

FINAL RANKING:
1. Response C
2. Response A
3. Response B
